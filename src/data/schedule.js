University, I’m here to help Anon’s cope with their issues, maybe give them a new perspective on their relationship, and help return to loving their waifu in a way that works for them.  (I’m very open minded, there’s no one “correct” way to love a mare.)

The first half of the Panel would just be a light hearted, comedic slide show.  I’ll share some of my best stories of having a Waifu, (Being pissed when I first discovered I have a pony wife, failed attempts at lucid dreaming (The CozyGlow courtcase), accidentally projecting a 10 foot tall Twilight Sparkle on stage during a professional orchestra performance.  I’ll also talk about the main issue I’ve had with waifusm, turning loving your Mare into a competition.

After hopefully getting some laughs and showing the crowd that I’m not some asshole here to judge, we can have an open mic where people can come up to the “Therapist Chair” and they can bring up any issues they are feeling, the audience is free to participate if they have any insight as well, I’m just a marelover I don’t have all the answers.
If no one comes up I have some prepared example problems that I saw during the previous MareFair, (One Anon felt guilty about liking Chrysalis Crushing things, another Anon felt guilty about having feelings for other Mares, Grief over his waifu not existing, etc.) I can give advice for these common problems.","Are you having relationship troubles with your mare?  Do you have no one to talk about these issues with?  Come to a free Waifu Therapy session!  Like minded individuals in a judgment free panel will do their best to help reignite your love with your Mare.  Do you have a healthy relationship with your Waifu?

I do not have a concrete plan yet, but here is my tentative outline:

Begin by playing the national anthem ('For the New Lunar Republic') and the presentation of the plushie, followed by a short introductory speech/slideshow
Then volunteers from the audience will be called up to confess their love, followed by watching clips from the show, possibly supplimented by fanart. (I will have plenty of content prepared in case there is low audience participation and/or turnout)

I am also considering a segment in which the audience may vote on the best foreign language dub (from a pool of 4-6 preselected ones, to keep the process simple)

A segment of the panel will also be dedicated to Nightmare Moon, but this is intended to be a surprise (She will 'hijack' the panel about 40-45 minutes in), thus this detail should be restricted to a need-to-know basis.

If we are allowed to serve refreshments, I might scour the nearest Publix in search of Moon Pies (because Luna) and Kool Aid (the beverage of choice for every good cult) beforehand.","A panel wherein we children of the night shall express our adoration for the bestest, dreamiest, and most bluest alicorn, Princess Luna, reminisce about why we love her so much, and gaze upon images of our goddess on the silver screen.","1 hour","Saturday 12am-2am","Friday 8pm-12am

Because this is the Luna panel, it would only make sense to hold it at night (between 8 PM and 6 AM, when there is no sun in the sky) on Friday or Saturday (Saturday preferred). If we have to start at 2 AM and stop at 3, we'll do it then. If absolutely no nighttime slots are available, a very early morning timeslot would be acceptable, though the attendees (and the best Princess) would be thoroughly disappointed.

A smaller room, like last year's 'Numget Memorial Stadium' would be preferred (Something like 'Tracy Cage' would be good too, I just don't want the 'Mare Stage')

I don't know how long this could go (if it attracts a large and engaged audience it could extend the timeframe), so I requested one hour as a minimum (If additional time is available, I will gladly take it). Ideally, it would be scheduled at midnight or 1 AM on Friday or (preferably) Saturday as the last event in a smaller room (Think 'Cult of Mare' from last year) so it can run as long as it needs to.

This would be a great way to make use of a smaller room late at night.","See panel title",,Accepted,,,,,,,,Completed,,0829a9cc-fb92-11ee-a8e4-0242ac120002,"Free Ride",148ec0dd-5420-11ef-a4db-0242ac120002,0.00,"2024-08-06 14:17:03","Free Ride",https://reg.marefair.org/apply/review.php?c=e&gid=0829a9cc-fb92-11ee-a8e4-0242ac120002&tid=148ec0dd-5420-11ef-a4db-0242ac120002,082b0030-fb92-11ee-a8e4-0242ac120002,CM*EA52*082B0030-FB92-11EE-A8E4-0242AC120002,https://reg.marefair.org/lib/res/barcode.php?s=qr&w=300&h=300&d=CM*EA52*082B0030-FB92-11EE-A8E4-0242AC120002,"2024-04-15 21:38:31","2024-08-03 19:44:21",

It had a big turnout and got 3/4 of the room filled. Free deodorant and frosted sugar cookies will also be given to everyone who is willing to come in for the panel. 

Another note I suppose is that last year this panel was called PPAS (pony posterior appreciation society). But, I changed it up because PLAP sounds funnier and easier to say. It's the exact same format as PPAS but it's just a different name. Same panel just slight new coat of paint to make it more enjoyable for everyone.

I will also have a co panelist that will help me out on stage and commentate about what is going on at the time. I will have them fill out their normal badge asap to help. Their fandom name is ""Missing Texture"" if that helps to find them in the normal badge goer pool.

One last note is that if panel slots are really tight and I don't get both of my panels I would prefer to have the ""PLAP"" panel over ""Rarity appreciation"" if it comes down to either or.
